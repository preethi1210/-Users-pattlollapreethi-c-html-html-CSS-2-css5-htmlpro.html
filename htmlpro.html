        <h1>What is C++?</h1>
        <p>C++ is a general purpose programming language and widely used now a days ' for competitive
            language and finds wide use in various GUI platforms, 3D graphics and real-time simulations.
            Because of the inclusion of rich function libraries, working in C++ becomes simpler and convenient than C. Being object-oriented programming like Java. C++ provides the support of inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, etc. Unlike C, C++ allows exception handling and function overloading.</p><br>
            <p>he "Hello World" program is the first step towards learning any programming language and also one of the simplest programs you will learn. All you have to do is display the message
                "Hello World" on the screen.</p><br>
                <p>Let us now look at the program:</p>
                  <pre id="code">
                      #include
                      using namespace std;
                      int main()
                      {
                        cout << "Hello World";
                        return 0;
                      }
                  </pre>  
                <p>C++ is an Object Oriented Programming Language.</p>
                <p>The main pillars of Object Oriented Programming are :</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Objects and Classes</li>
                    <li>Inheritance</li>
                    <li>Polymorphism</li>
                    <li>Abstraction</li>
                    <li>Encapsulation</li>
                </ul>

       <section  id="Obj & class">
        <h1>Objects and Classes</h1>
        <p>Object-onented programming.As the name suggests uses objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-worid entities like inhentance, luding. polymorphism, etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function</p><br>
        <p><b>Object :</b>An Object is an identifiable entity with some characteristics and behavior An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (re. an object is created) memory is allocated</p><br>
        <p><b>Class:</b>The building block of C- that leads to Object Oriented programming is a Class It is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed & used by creating an instance of that class. A class is like a blueprint for an object. For Example. Consider the Class of Cars. There may be many cars with different names and brand but all of them will share some common properties like all of them will have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Milenge range etc. So here, Car is the class and wheels, speed limits, mleage are their properties</p>

        <h1>Inheritance</h1>
        <p>The capability of a ciass to derve properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance. Inhentance is one of the most important feature of Object Oriented Programming Sub Class: The class that mhents properties from another class is called Sub class or Derived Claw Super Class. The class whose properties are inhented by sub class is calied Base Class or Super class. Using inheritance, we have to write the functions only one time matead of three times as we hate inherited rest of the three classes from base class(Velicle). </p>
        <h3>Mode of Inheritance:</h3>
        <p><b>Public Mode:</b>If we derive a sub class from a public base class. Then the public member of the base class will become public in the derived class and protected members of the base class will ecrome protected in denses class</p>
        <p><b>Protected Mode:</b>If we derive a sub class from a Protected base class. Then both public member and protected members of the base class will become protected in dented class.</p>
        <p><b>Private Mode:</b>If we derive a sub class from a Private base class. Then both public member and protected members of the base class will become Pivate in derited class.</p>
        <h4>Types of Inheritance in C++</h4>
        <p><b>Single Inberitance:</b>In single inheritance, a class is allowed to inherit from only one class se, one sub class is inherited by one base class only.</p>
        <p><b>Multiple Inheritance:</b>Multiple Inheritance is a feature of C-- where a class can herit from more than one classes. te one sub class is inherited from more than one base classes</p>
        <p><b>Multilevel Inheritance:</b>In this type of mhentance, a derived class is created from another</p>
        <p><b>Hieratical Inheritance:</b>In this type of inheritance, more than one sub class is inherited from a single base class ie more than one derred ciass is created from a single base clam        </p>
        <p><b>Hybrid (Virtual) Inheritance:</b>Hybrid Inheritance is implemented by combing more than one type of inheritance. For example. Combung Hierarchical inhertance and Mititiple</p><br>

    <section id="Poly">
        <h1>Polymorphism</h1>
        <p>The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. A real-life example of polymorphism, a person at the same tume can have different characteristics, Like a man at the same tume is a father. a husband, an employee So the same person posses dufferent behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphiam. Polymorplusm is considered as one of the important features of Object Oriented Programming .</p>
            <h4>In C++ polymorphism is mainly divided into two types:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Compile time Polymorphim</ul>
                <li>Runtime Polymorphism</ul>
            </ol>
            <p>Compile time polymorphism This type of polymorphism is achiesed by function overloading of operator overloading</p>
            <p>Runtune polymorphism This type of polymorphism is achieved by Function Overding</p>
    </section>
    <section  id="abs">
        <h1>Abstraction</h1>
        <p>Data abstraction is one of the most essential and important feature of object oriented programming in C* Abstraction means displaying only essential iformation and luding the details Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation</p>
        <p>Consider a real life example of a man driving a car. The man only knows that pressing the accelerators will mcrease the speed of car or applying brakes will stop the car but he does not know about how on pressing accelerator the speed is actually increasing. he does not knon about the inner mechanism of the cer or the implementation of accelerator, brakes etc in the car.</p>
        <p><b>Abstraction using Classes:</b>We can implement Abstraction in C- wing classes Class helps us to group data members and member functions using available access specifiers A Class can decide which data member will be visible to outside world and which is not</p>
        <p><b>Abstraction in Header files:</b>One more type of abstraction in C+ can be header files. For example, connder the pow method present in math h header file Whenever we need to calculate power of a number, we simply call the function pow present in the math h header file and pass the numbers as arguments without knowing the underlying algorithm according to which the function is actually caleulating power of numbers.</p>
            <h4>Advantages of Data Abstraction:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Helps the user to avoid writing the low level code.</li>
                <li>Avoids code dupitcation and increases reusability</li>
                <li>Can change internal implementation of class independently without affecting the user</li>
                <li>Helps to increase security of an application or program as only important detais are provided to the user.</li>
            </ol>

        <h1>Encapsulation</h1>
        <p>In normal terms Encapsulation is defined as napping up of data and mfor ation under a single unt. In Object Onented Progrimming, Encapsulation is defined as binding together the</p>
